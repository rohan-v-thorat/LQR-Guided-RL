# LQR-Guided-RL-controller
This repository contains the code used to produce the results presented in the conference paper titled "Safe Reinforcement Learning-Based Vibration Control: Overcoming Training Risks with LQR Guidance".

## Overview
This project implements a reinforcement learning (RL) based vibration control system guided by Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) principles. The main objective is to achieve safe and effective control in vibration systems by integrating classical LQR control insights into the RL policy training process.
